Bisection Algorithm
given a, b, such that f(a) < 0 and f(b) > 0

midpoint m = (a + b) / 2;
if f(m) > 0 then b moves to midpoint
else a moves to midpoint

Function Pointer:
- function identifiers (name) like Bisect or Main
are really labels for the memory location where the function instructions start
- C functions are first class citizens
this means that, just liek other types, they can be stored in variables 
we can have a variable that is a function pointer
can be passed as arguments and returned from functions
