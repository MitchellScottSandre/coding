Lambda Functions:
- anonymous functions (unnamed)
- you write the function body..usually it is being passed to another function
- one of the paramters in the function call could be another function body
- usful for simple functions (usually just one or two lines) invoked from one place
compil with g++ and -std=c++11; named *.cc

eg

//    this is a pointer to a function that takes an integer and has no return value
void (*f)(int) = [](int i) {printf("%d\n", i);}
			//   the square brackes identifies the start of the lambda function
			//the int i is the parameter list of the lambda function
			//the return type is inferred from the body by the compiler

we can call f, pass it an integer, and it will output the int
f(42); //--> prints 42

The Auto Key Word:
auto g = [](int i){printf("%d\n", i);};  //here, the type of g is inferred b the compiler

Ex: with stdlib qsort function
