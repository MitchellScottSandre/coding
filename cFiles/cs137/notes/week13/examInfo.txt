Final Exam:
closed book.
cummulative (emphasis will be on everything since the mid term)
20 questions (letter a to t) x 4 marks each
ratio: 40 % no code in the answer (true false, what is the output, find the errors), 60% write functions
not one question makes you write an entire program
no exams in this course in the exam bank so...

best practice for the exam is looking at notes and re doing assignments
Ex of questions:
- find errors
- what does this print
- True False
- big O stuff (run time complexity..maybe space complexity)
- Unicode (binary representation)
- at least remember the pattern of encoding stuff to unicode
-pointers 
- structs
- tail recursion --> what does using tail recursion mean --> ex: impliment,  fibinacci function using tail recursion
- no map/reduce
- no lambda
- no macros, no linked lists
- strings
- NO page rank
								GCD             prime			function evaluation
- algorithms (GCD, prime, euclids algorithm, eratosthenes, horner's algorithm, bisection)

- sorting and searching
- selection, insertion, merge, quick, linear and binary
- memorize best and worst
		best/worst							space
selection	n squared, nsquared					1
insertion n, n squared							1
merge  nlogn, nlogn								n
quick nlogn, n squared							n in worst case
linear											
binary
