The C++ Standard Temmplate Library:
- C++ has general purpose library of generic classes and functions called the Standard Template Library (STL)
1. Generic Containers that take the element type as a parameter
	Ex: vector, list, deque, map, set, stack, queue, etc
2. kids of iterators that can navigate through the containers
3. algorithms that take an iterator and perform an interesting operation on the elements in that Range
	Ex: sort, random_shuffle, next_permutation

Iterators:
- the iterator is a fundamental design pattern of OOP
	- it represents an abstract way of
