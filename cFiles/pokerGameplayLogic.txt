so, every player can raise, once the last player has raised everyone has to have the opportunity to call
10 players
need a boolean: continueGettingPlayerBets
each player: boolean allowedToRaise;
if (allowedToRaise == true) they can raise, otherwise they can only check, fold, call
so lets say 10 players. number 4 is dealer (bottom, count goes clockwise)
5 is SM, 6 is BB
7 has to match the BB, or can bet
8 - 10, then 1 - 6 can keep calling, checking, betting, raising
have int mostRecentBet? (reset at beginning of round, set to 0)
if mostRecentBet < amountToCall, then it is their turn again

once everyone's mostRecentBet == amountToCall or other people have folded
