Cracking The Coding Interview Notes:

How to Handle Technical Questions

1. ASK QUESTIONS
- what type of data, what type of list?

2. DESIGN AN ALGORITHM
- space and time complexities
- what if there is a lot of data

3. PESUEDO CODE

4. CODE:
- use data structures generously

5. TEST
- extreme cases, negative, full, maximums
- normal cases

5 Algorithm Approaches:

Examplify
-write out specific examples of the problem, see if you can figure out a general rule

Pattern Matching:
- consider what problems the algorithm is similar to, and figure out if you can modify the solution to develop an algorithm for this problem
