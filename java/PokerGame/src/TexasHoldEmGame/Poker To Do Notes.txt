Poker Game TO DO:
De 16th:
- when you go all in, it still asks for and is waiting for your turn (but you have 0 money)
----> if someone goes all in, you everyone else can either call or raise or fold...then deal the rest of the cards!
-----> TO DO: just make sure that everyone has called and such. then, just increase round_turnCounter and deal cards etc and go
to the River (5 cards up)
DEC 12:
--> when you go all in(second round)...it STILL ASKS asks for user's turn
Work out what happens when you go all in...needs to get everyones call (or raise???) and then deal out rest of cards

TO DO: add which round number it is to the board COMPLETED
TO DO: every x rounds (not time???) increase the minimum bet!!! and big blinds and small blinds

dec 11th:
ERROR: when I go all in and there are less than 10 players, it makes other players have negative money..why??
ERROR: sometimes displayning coins (as though I could click them and select it to bet) even when I have no coins
ERROR: go all in..doesn't use all coins??? go all in...people get to 0 dollars. remove them from game! if user gets SOLVE
to 0 dollars, end game
ERROR: don't want it saying "backdoor" if there is only 1 card left to be put on table ... you can't get the two cards needed to make
that hand!!! FIXED
TO DO: add "recommended move" to display user info... :( currently its deleting...(only displays for 2 cards on table)...before 
that it was constantly calling and checking getDecision() which changes because it calls random numbers!!!  FIXED

Dec 9th
TO DO: improve change in coin function --deffinitly add in some 1000 and 5000 chips !!
added--> more player hand info stuff, including NAME / nick name of the hand
--> it's pretty damn good actually. lot of variety of names!
COOL TO DO: at end of round, print to the same file info like how many players and the winning hand --> can, later, calculate the odds of how often each winning hand occurs
TO DO: so be able to finish game. 1) player goes all in. 2) player is out of money. 3) everyone else is out of money. only one person left
fixed font
fixed player display information --> added ROUND BET, changed total amount bet to TURN BET

Show them what the name of their current hand is (pair, three of a kind, etc)
Show them number of outs
Show them pot odds
Show them player odds
Show them the name --> basedOnTheirOdds --> backdoor inside straight
Suggest what they do! (Think of what else to show them...)

Dec 7th
fixed the BUG
ERROR: sometimes, not getting the rest of the player's turns --> changed line 998 in PokerGame to try and fix it..
--->reason: never before were people purely calling ... sometimes with new logic people don't raise!
TO MAKE: Eventually, I want to add a function addLinesToScrollingInfoToShowCardsNicely --> for at the end of round
ERROR:asking for userTurn when user has raised, everyone else has called (it has gone around the table...)
people are not folding enough...
So integrated the new getMoveNE function..works fine...but when user isbb it just skils and goes to end?
Error when all other players have folded...just keeps waiting and asking for the user's turn...
SO...need to have a boolean allOtherPlayersHaveFolded and if it is true for someone just give them all of the pot money
ONLY get a player's move if everyone else has NOT folded, otherwise, they automatically win and don't get the chance to also fold

Dec 6th:
need to integrate computer calculations program into the GAME
ERROR: Once I do that, i can review random cases and add tweaks and gix bugs to the computer move calcualtor
--->FIXED --> checked that computer 1's move string is not " " meaning that they have played! Comp 1 will always
be in the game regardless of the number of players chosen
dec 5th
ERROR: when players are less than 10, if it is end of round (I will be BB next) and I click NEXT ROUND, then it goes to nextround,
and immediately deals out all the cards (i can't bet) --> has to do, im guessing, with that player is big blind boolean...
ERROR: fixed most issues with less than 10 players
when there are LESS THAN (or equal to) 4 players --> ISSUE. this is because we are doing get next player (5) --> that 5 is the issue
might need to make that 5 be a variable, and that variable is p->getNextPlayer or something
fixed and added stuff to correct straight flush, royal flush, and flush --> if there are bugs with these, check it out
QUESTION: might want to change logic of (sum) for move calculator...because I can make the scale more even (continuous)
and then do myOdds * sum = output_number. if output number is good enough (meaning my odds * the goodness of what hand that gives)
then I bet (also comare against the player's personality settings)

dec 4th
ERROR: why can't i make a game with less than 10 players?
for this error, i think we should be using
getNextPlayerOnTableThatHasNotFolded
instead of getNextPlayerOnTable
either that or getNextPlayerOnTable IS WRONGGGG
FIXED: so first round now works fine... but then it goes into infinite loop after first round...why???
so ERROR: less than 10 players, second round, infinite loop :(
ERROR: when it calls playersTableORder at that index, well, all players at THAT index is out of bounds@
fixed that ish
ERROR: when num players is 5, well im doing p = 5 (next person after p (usually)) % numPlayers... should be the next person (index on table)


need to use: boolean someoneAllInOnFlop in case someone goes all in
ERROR: royal flush logic is wrong
need to: make one, or two, cardsAwayFromStraight() function
started reading outs and counting them and stuff..pretty cool
NEED TO INCLUDE COOL TERMS like gut shot straight draw etc etc --> fun!!
need to read: http://www.pokerology.com/lessons/drawing-odds/..and understand how to do probability-based betting
continue adding logic to player decision calculator.. ADDED PERSONALITIES!!!!! now just adding functions to judge how good hand is
add notes folder to the source code so it gets saved on github
Dec 2, 2016
need to PLAN out player bet calculatory better --> include personalities, plus include difficulty!!!
ugh.. make it dynamic in size!!!
...having a recommend button.. --> could just have a USE recommendation button too...just automate the game!
eventually...maybe have a recommend BUTTON???/ this is a cool ideaaaa
NEED TO: make lastRaiseAmount logic in player/round/game logic...this will be used to determine comp move!!!
continued comp move calculator logic ... changed some things to the deck to let me just make deck with val and suit
oh no! it is dealing the 4tth and 5th cards at the same time!!! WHYY --> just made time between rounds 0 seconds. leave it.
to do: add "Next Round" button.. DONE
fixed tie logic... DONE
Full house --> kings full of Jacks KKKJJ DONE
error with tie logic...going to user (index 0).. :(FIXED
because when we create the new round the initial values of indexOfDealer is set to indexOfDealer = STARTindexofdealer..
hey. why the fuck aren't hte big blinds and small blinds etc. rotating??? FIXED
ERROR: when I set the time between turns to 0...it breaks FIXED
what the hell happens if someone goes all in?? look at rules.
they need to have enough money..else need to split the pot..ugh ugh ugh
fixed (ish) checkIfNotEnoughCoins...but what if the player is out of money!!!!
add delay between rounds FIXED
to do eventually: write out completly how this thing works! refer TO EVERYSINGLE FUNCTION NAME
need to be able to trade chips from higher to lower (trade in a 1000 40 x 25 etc etc... FIXED
found out why! THEY HAVE 0 x 5 dollar chips!!!! added an i++ in the right loop and fixed it aha
keeps freezing and crashing and idky
ERROR: it keeps getting frozen at 3rd round (1, 2, 3) after showing the first 3 cards...probably because comp 7 has folded?
whats the differene between 3rd round after flop and second round after flop??
- ERROR: if user has folded, and user is SB, then (first off, it doesn't rotate people) but then it just is a bug and thinks 
user is still folded at beginning of next round
- if USER folded..then stop showing user cards too DONE
- added tie code... BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT SCOTT you only go to check next highest card some of the time...for some things (like straights) 
 you just SPLIT THE POT :(
add RULES to start page!
options menu in top right.
QUESTION: what if COMP is SB or BB and one of them has folded? BOTH of them????
ERROR: there was just a tie... both had pair of queens high..need to make a tie breaker function
--> look at the rules for this.. either award cased off of next highest card or divide up pot! make that into a funciton too...

- nov 29th
when they FOLD, put their cards away! they should dissappear (just flipped them over instead)...
Comp folding works fine now..skips them correctly!!!
Need to WORK ON MAKING COMP LOGIC FOR PLAYING!!!!!
//maybe make a new class comp_decision_to_play?
//pass it hand, cards shown, their money, etc etc

- test out other computer functions like fold, check
- test them out for user TOO
- fold will be an issue...need to be getting next player on table!!!!! not just p++
- also applies to having less than 10 ppl on the table


- when player is out of money, remove them from game! either change arrays...or change getNextPLayerOnTable function
- ERROR has "comp raised by 0"... for Big Blind...so something is happening when user raises as Small pBlind and / i thinnk BB fixed
- ERROR: if user is small blind, and then raises right away, theyve bet 10 + 210 but it says total is 210!fixed
- check for consistency, "user raised; " ... vs "comp 8, raised" COMMA VS SEMI COLON
- ERROR: user raises, doesn't set new amount to call! Fixed? Double check this!

- user should only be allowed to BET or ALL

- user call button works wrong, adds an aditional 20$ if previous person is BB
