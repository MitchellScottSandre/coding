What do I want my website to look / act like?

Really go for a minimalist design

Main Block at Top --> gets pushed to side when you scroll down to other sections, but always have those links available
Links to:
A Bit About Me
My Projects
My Resume
Important Links (facebook, github, wakatime, linkedin)

Have the block scroll down and hit next block, top block gets pushed out of sight (like apple scrolling) )

For the first page (top, user just came to this website)...have some sort of Javascript game/animation thing that is random/repeats
..we are waiting for user to scroll down
EX: fish swimming, you can click and drop food in to the water, fish move to eat it, there is a ripple on the water
EX: ballons that float around, come up, come down around... some type of animal/creature is just walking around...kicks the balloons when they get too close!
(maybe it pops balloons...user can click to add a balloon)

The background of the animation at the top of the screen should have "Scroll Down" as its background...

On right, have scroll bar that is representive of size of total page (so you can see what is coming up next)

These links link to different locations below on the page
scrolls down, colours for different sections, nice animations

For the My Projects Section, have arrows so user can navigate left and right to see projects (project slides in, nice animation)
